The purpose of this course is to share a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand.   

Accordingly, in this course, you will learn:  

- The major steps involved in practicing data science 
- Forming a business/research problem, collecting, preparing & analyzing data, building a model, 
  deploying a model and understanding the importance of feedback  
- Apply the 6 stages of the CRISP-DM methodology, the most popular methodology for Data Science and Data Mining problems 
- How data scientists think! 

To apply the methodology, you will work on a real-world inspired scenario and work with Jupyter Notebooks using Python to develop hands-on experience.
